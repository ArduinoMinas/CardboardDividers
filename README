k# Cardboard Dividers
OpenSCAD template/script for laser cutting cardboard holders for (primarily) networking equipment to go in hardcases (Pelicans).

Currently the code supports specifying the dimensions of your hard case, the size of your objects, and the number of items you want to store. **NOTE:** The code has a hardcoded width of 2 items; a PR is welcome if you modify the code to support an arbitrary number of items wide.

Photos are at the end of the `README`.

# Creating a DXF
Modify the parameters in OpenSCAD until you've gotten a layout you're happy with. **Make sure** you render the the design first, and **then** use OpenSCAD's `Export as DXF...` feature. OpenSCAD will happily export a DXF of your last render, without letting you know you need to re-render due to changes.
